# Zero-Shot Object Detection
Zero-shot object detection is a computer vision task to detect objects and their classes in images, without any prior training or knowledge of the classes. Zero-shot object detection models receive an image as input, as well as a list of candidate classes, and output the bounding boxes and labels where the objects have been detected.

# About Zero-Shot Object Detection

## Use Cases
Zero-shot object detection models can be used in any object detection application where the detection involves text queries for objects of interest.

## Object Search
Zero-shot object detection models can be used in image search. Smartphones, for example, use zero-shot object detection models to detect entities (such as specific places or objects) and allow the user to search for the entity on the internet.

## Object Counting
Zero-shot object detection models are used to count instances of objects in a given image. This can include counting the objects in warehouses or stores or the number of visitors in a store. They are also used to manage crowds at events to prevent disasters.

## Object Tracking
Zero-shot object detectors can track objects in videos.
